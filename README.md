# Line Drawing Algorithms with Pygame

This project demonstrates **DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer)** and **Bresenham‚Äôs Line Drawing Algorithm** using Python's `pygame` library. It's a simple visual implementation that plots a line between two points on a 2D screen.

## üöÄ Features

- DDA Line Drawing Algorithm
- Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm (with decision parameter `p`)
- Pygame-based visualization
- Clean and minimal interface


##  Algorithms Explained

### DDA Algorithm
- Uses floating-point operations.
- Calculates intermediate points between start and end.
- Suitable for any slope.

### Bresenham‚Äôs Algorithm
- Uses only integer operations.
- Efficient for raster displays.
- Uses a decision variable `p` to determine the next pixel.

## üõ† Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pygame` library

```bash
pip install pygame
